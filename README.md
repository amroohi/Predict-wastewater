# Predict-wastewater
Predicting effluent characteristics of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP)

In this project, in order to predict the effluent characteristics of wastewater treatment plant, machine learning models were made in R and Python languages, which include the following:

1- Bayesian network: `bnlearn` continuous variables and `bnclassify` discrete variables

2- `stpredict`

3- `sklearn` KNN, DT, MLP, LR, GLM, BDT
