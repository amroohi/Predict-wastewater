# Predict-wastewater

In this project, in order to predict the effluent characteristics of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), several machine learning models were established in R and Python languages, which include the following:

1- Bayesian network: `bnlearn` for continuous variables and `bnclassify` for discrete variables

2- `stpredict` for time-varying variables

3- `sklearn` KNN, DT, MLP, LR, GLM, BDT, GBM
